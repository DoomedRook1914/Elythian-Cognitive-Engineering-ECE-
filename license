### **üîπ Key Improvements:**
‚úî **Clarifies that this is not a standard MIT License** (which allows commercial use).  
‚úî **Explicitly defines ‚ÄúNon-Commercial Use‚Äù** to prevent misunderstandings.  
‚úî **Adds a Commercial Licensing Clause** so users know they must contact you for permission.  
‚úî **Keeps it legally enforceable while still being clear and readable.**

This should now **clearly protect your work** while allowing research and personal use.

Would you like me to draft a **separate Commercial License** template in case companies reach out for a license? üöÄ
